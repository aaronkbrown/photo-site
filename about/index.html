        <h1>About David Brown</h1>
        <p>Hi, and thanks for visiting!</p>
        <p>I am an amateur photographer living in the Pacific Northwest. I enjoy all kinds of photography, from wildlife to macro. I shoot with a Canon 7D Mark II crop frame and a Canon 6D full frame.</p>
        <p>I acquired my first two cameras with my paper route money when I was in 8th grade&mdash;a Speed Graphic 2&frac14; x 3&frac14; and a Yashica 35mm SLR. I learned to develop my own film, so my father and I built an enlarger for printing. When Acufine came on the market, I learned to push my Tri-X to ASA 1600 and got great sports shots for my high school yearbook.</p>
        <p>In my early 20s, I got a Minolta of some kind and began processing color slides. I also tried my hand at color prints with some limited success, but then photography got away from me.</p>
        <p>I later married a woman who had a Canon AE-1 and kind of took it over from her, but we just took pictures of our children as they grew up.</p>
        <p>When digital arrived, I went through a series of point-and-shoots but was always looking for a sharper image. In January 2013, I broke down and bought a Canon Rebel, and I've been thoroughly engrossed in photography since then.</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy looking at my pictures as much as I've enjoyed taking them!</p>
